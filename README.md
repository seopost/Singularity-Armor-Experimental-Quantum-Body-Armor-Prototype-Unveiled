**August 2025 — Pacific Systems Tech Corporation**

Pacific Systems Tech Corporation, a public benefits corporation, has announced the launch of [Singularity](https://singularityarmor.com) Armor, an experimental new class of protective technology described as functional anti-nuclear blast quantum body armor.

The venture is led by Reverend Kenny Tran, Founder of Pacific Systems Tech Corporation, who is positioning Singularity Armor as a not-for-profit initiative to explore next-generation civilian and humanitarian defense. Tran, formerly the CFO of Incuvation Labs LLC and Multiverse Games Inc.—the studio behind Nemexia, the popular MMORTS browser game—brings a background that uniquely blends technology entrepreneurship, finance, and innovative system design.

At its core, Singularity Armor is designed not as conventional ballistic armor but as a quantum-structured protective shell that operates on the level of mathematics, physics, and information science. Early prototypes demonstrate the armor’s ability to absorb and neutralize forces that far exceed the limits of traditional military gear. Instead of relying on thickness or material hardness, the system enforces protective outcomes by warping spacetime metrics, collapsing damaging probabilities, and maintaining informational integrity. In short, the armor doesn’t simply resist destruction—it mathematically prevents it.

While still in its prototype and beta stage, Singularity Armor is already being released in limited quantities for testing. Pacific Systems Tech emphasizes that this project is highly experimental and primarily aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of protection against catastrophic threats, including nuclear-scale blast environments. According to the team, even in simulation trials, the armor maintains structural integrity with negligible residual stress—orders of magnitude below any level that could cause harm to the wearer.

As Tran explains, “This is a very cool product that can do a lot of good in the world.”

Singularity Armor remains under active development, but for those eager to experience the future of protection, prototypes are already available.
